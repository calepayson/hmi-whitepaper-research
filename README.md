## Overview

To think about where AI is going and what mass adoption might look like it's important to look back at other waves of innovation. It doesn't mean this will be the same, but there might be some things to take away, especially go-to-market motions.

We're going to start by studying two themes:

1. **The mass adoption of the cloud**. Understanding how it came about, what companies got ahead and why, and which didn't. This is meant to bee a focus on the disruptive nature of a new go-to-market/business model paired with a tech breakthrough.

2. **The adoption of developer tools and bottoms-up/PLG motions**. The best example is Stripe vs. PayPal but there are many more. What does it take to win horizontally? What companies succeeded/failed and why?

The first theme will be a great way to think about a new technology powering all systems. The second will be a good way to think about what tool companies might be succeessful and what strategies they should think about. GTM motions don't ever change too much so it's really helpful to understand them.
