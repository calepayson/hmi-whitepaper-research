## The Cloud

X as a service. The key is compute

### [The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf)

**Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing:**
- **On-Demand Self-Service** - "A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider."
- **Broad Network Acceess** - "Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations)."
- **Resource Pooling** - "The providerâ€™s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth."
- **Rapid Elasticity** - "Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time."
- **Measured Service** - "Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability1 at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service."

## Loudcloud

The first true cloud company.

### [Crank It Up](https://www.wired.com/2000/08/loudcloud/)

- Loudcloud (now Opsware) was founded in late 1999 by Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, Tim Howes, and Sik Rhee.
- It was concieved of by Sik Rhee, former CTO of the ecommerce platform division at AOL, when the founding team was looking to build a new company together. He noticed that when a company was initially listed on AOL, the traffic to their website would 10X-100X and the site would inevitably crash. Rather than building a new website, he proposed building a company that built scalable web infrastructure.
- There were plenty of companies building websites for other companies but Loudcloud stood out for an emphasis on scalability through automation. Other companies scaled linearly, they had to hire a new team to build a new site. Loudcloud was able to do it with a few keystrokes and little extra manpower.
- They also automated the sites' ability to scale during increased or reduced traffic.
- Loudcloud offered a number of "clouds" like a Database Cloud or a Mail Cloud and users paid a monthly fee based on the cloud capacity they used.
- If a customer wanted to add functionality, Loudcloud would drop in a new "cloud"
- Loudcloud was the first known cloud provider to hit all the NIST criteria.

### [Update: Loudcloud now Opsware, sells part of business to EDS](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2576654/update--loudcloud-now-opsware--sells-part-of-business-to-eds.html)

- Loudcloud renamed itself to Opsware in 2002 and sold its managed services business.
- Opsware was the name of Loudcloud's IT automation software.
- This meant loudcloud pivoted from building websites to selling software that allowed companies to build them.
- Editorial note: this seems like the death blow for Loudcloud as a cloud company. At this point they supplied software to companies that helped them develop an "internal" cloud instead of cloud computing and storage as a service.

### [The Hard Thing About Hard Things](http://library.lol/main/77F9C848EC4403E988972C467FC17949)

- Loudcloud was initially financed by Benchmark Capital and Marc Andreessen. Benchmark put in $15m at a pre-money valuation of $45m. Andreessen invested an additional $6m.
- After two months they raised an additional $45m from Morgan Stanley in debts with no payment for three years.
- Advice from Andy Rachleff of Benchmark Capital: "Think about how you might run the business if capital were free".
- Initially they averaged hiring 30 employees a month.
- Nine months in they booked $27m of new contracts in a quarter.
- This is about when the dot-com crash hit.
- They had spent $66m to build a cloud service and needed to raise money again
- Raised a series C at $700m pre-money and raised $120m in Q1 2000. 
- In Q2 2000 they expected $100m in sales but only booked $37m.
- Needed to raise more in Q4 2000 but couldn't find an investor.
